/**
 * Roman Time!
 * 
 * Implement the function that given a regular time, 
 * e.g. "09:05" or "23:12" returns the same time but written in roman numbers.
 * 
 * "09:05" -> IX:V
 * 
 * Important!
 * 1. Roman numbers don't have 0 (surprise!). Use `N` instead
 * 2. You might get any number/word as an input. If the input is not valid, throw a TypeError.
