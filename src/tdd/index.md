# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Following TDD methodologies helps us achieve a much cleaner code, higher test coverage and ensure we are following the [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) principle and make sure we are not optimizing prematurely, but above all, TDD helps the needs dictate the design.

## Goals 
1. Understand the principals and methodology of TDD
1. Practice, practice, practice and more practice

## Exercise
1. [Bowling TDD Kata](https://github.com/wix-private/bowling-tdd-kata)
2. Implement [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game using TDD
