# What is JavaScript?

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is the most popular programming language in the world. 
It is most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/). 

It is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language; small and lightweight. Inside a host environment (e.g., a web browser), 
JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

- ***Client-side JavaScript*** extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

- ***Server-side JavaScript*** extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

# Learn

#### Syntax

  JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python. To that end, pick the most relevant link for you from this list, based on the language you are already familiar with:
  
- **[For the Totally Clueless](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-1h.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Browse this guide for syntax you don’t already know, especially working with numbers, strings, loops, functions and arrays.

  All you need to know to get started with JS coming from Java, C#, php or other OOP languages.

  If you are somewhat familiar with JS and just need an overview or get up to date, here's a cheat-sheet you can thoroughly explore. In addition, make sure you're all set with using the [Strict Mode](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch07.html#strict_mode).


#### Scoping and Patterns

  JavaScript’s implementation of scope and context is a unique feature of the language, in part because it is so flexible. Functions can be adopted for various contexts and scope can be encapsulated and preserved. These concepts lend to some of the most powerful design patterns JavaScript has to offer. However, this is also a tremendous source of confusion amongst developers, and for good reason.
  
- **[Understanding Scope and Context](http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  The difference between scope and context and how various design patterns make use of them.

  Learn how to master the *this* keyword, which confuses new and seasoned JavaScript developers alike.

  Familiarize yourself with the traditional ‘Object Literal Pattern’.


#### Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - 
that treats computation as the evaluation of functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

- **[Immutability](http://www.sitepoint.com/immutability-javascript/)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-30m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Covers what immutability is, how to use it in JavaScript and why it's useful.

- **[Stateful vs. Stateless](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/101337/whats-the-difference-between-stateful-and-stateless)** <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/time-5m.png"></img></a> <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/wix/fed-training-kit/blob/master/assets/tag-read.png"></img></a>   
  Practical approach for thinking 'stateless' when you code.

  Hoisting, higher-order functions and closures.


#### Data Interchange with JSON

[JSON](http://json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for creating and sending data objects. JSON is a part of JavaScript and not a separate entity, the notation syntax is built into the raw Javascript programming language.

As a simple example, information about me might be written in JSON as follows:

```
var jason = {
  "age" : "24",
  "hometown" : "Missoula, MT",
  "gender" : "male"
};
```

This creates an object that we access using the variable `jason`. 
Inside the object, we can declare any number of properties using a `"name": "value"` pairing, separated by commas. 
To access the information stored in jason, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. For instance:

`document.write('Jason is ' jason.age); // Output: Jason is 24`

Many applications use JSON for data interchange. [This](http://graph.facebook.com/youtube) for example, is the JSON data of Facebook's [Youtube page](http://www.facebook.com/youtube). The page's name, number of likes etc. are all represented in pairs, as we've learned, allowing update of the page's data.

That's the gist.
